## Project Overview
The Health Insurance Data Analysis and Visualization project leverages Python and data visualization libraries to analyze key metrics in the health insurance domain. This project helps in understanding:

- Distribution of insurance charges based on demographic and health factors
- Correlations between variables such as age, BMI, and smoking status
- Trends in data that can assist insurance companies and policymakers

## Technologies Used
- **Python**: Core programming language for data analysis
- **Pandas**: Data manipulation and cleaning
- **Matplotlib/Seaborn**: Data visualization
- **NumPy**: Numerical computations
- **Jupyter Notebook**: Interactive environment for code execution and visualization

## Features
- Data cleaning and preprocessing
- Exploratory data analysis (EDA)
- Interactive visualizations
- Insights generation for decision-making

## Data
The dataset used in this project contains information on:
- Age
- Gender
- BMI (Body Mass Index)
- Children (Number of dependents)
- Smoking status
- Region
- Insurance charges

### Source
The dataset is either publicly available or simulated for educational purposes. Ensure that the dataset is placed in the appropriate directory before running the project.
